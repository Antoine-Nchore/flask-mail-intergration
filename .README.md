<b>Send an E-mail with python Flask</b>

Web-based applications typically require the ability to send mail to the user/client. Flask doesn’t have an out of the box solution to send mail.

Instead, the Flask-Mail extension makes it easy to eastablish a simple interface with any mail server.

Email generally uses two protocols, one for sending mails (smtp) and the other for receiving mail (pop3). This article is about sending mail.


<b>Introduction</b>


First, the Flask-Mail extension should be installed with the help of the pip utility.

	Pip install Flask-Mail

You then need to configure the Flask-Mail by setting the values for the following application parameters.

	MAIL_SERVER
	MAIL_USE_TLS
	MAIL_USE_SSL
	MAIL_DEBUG
	MAIL_DEBUG
	MAIL_USERNAME
	MAIL_PASSWORD
	MAIL_DEFAULT_SENDER
	MAIL_MAX_EMAILS
	MAIL_SUPPRESS_SEND
	MAIL_ASCII_ATTACHMENTS

Flask-mail module contains definitions of the following important classes.

The mail class manages email messaging requirements. The class cnstructor the form of:
	
	flask-mail.Mail(app= None)

Mail class methods include: send(), connect() and send_message() .

The email class encapsulated an email. The message constructor has several parameters:

	flas-mail.Message(subject, recipients, body, ht,l, sender, cc, 	bcc, reply-to, date, charset, extra_headers, mail_options)

Message class method attach() -Add attachment for mail. This method takes the following parameters:


	filename: The name of the filename
	content_type: MIME type
	data-file

You can add_recipient() to another recipient to the message.


<b>Mail config and functions</b>

In the example below, the SMTP server for the google gmail service is used as the MAIL_SERVER for the flask-mail configuration.

Step 1: Import the Mail and Message classes from the flask-mail module in the code.

	From flask_mail import Mail, Message 

Step 2: Configure server parameters 

	app.config[ ‘MAIL_SERVER’] = ‘smtp.gmail.com’
	app.config[‘MAIL_PORT’] = 465
	app.config[‘MAIL_USERNAME’] = ‘anthonynchore@gmail.com’
	app.config[‘MAIL_PASSWORD’] = ‘******’
	app.congig[MAIL_USE_TLS’] = False
	app.config[‘MAIL_USE_SSL’] = True

Step 3: Create an instance of the Mail class

mail = Mail(app)

Step 4: The message object is set in a python function that is mapped by the URL rule (‘/’)

@app.route(“/”)
def index():
	msg  = Message (‘Hello’, sender = ‘anthonynchore@gmail.com’, 			recipient  = [‘someone1@gmail.com’])
	msg.body = “This is the email body”
	mail.send(msg)
	return “sent”
